  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if we can develop a good graft for oral mucosal tissue
      that is like the top of the mouth in a &quot;test tube&quot; that could be used successfully in humans.
      We have already done this successfully mice. The next step is to take a small piece of tissue
      from a human volunteer and see if we can grow a larger piece of tissue from it outside the
      human body and graft it back into the same person successfully. We expect that this technique
      will work. It has already been tried in patients with burns of the skin who have had similar
      procedures where the skin is grafted back to them. The significance of this research is that
      oral tissue taken from the top of the mouth or palate is in limited supply and leaves the
      patient with a painful and uncomfortable post surgery experience. If we are successful with
      our technique the patient will experience less pain and discomfort from the site that we are
      using to grow our tissue outside the body than if we had taken it from the top of the mouth
      or palate. In addition, by waiting longer periods to grow the patient's cells we can make
      larger pieces of oral tissue than we could have gotten directly from the patient's mouth.
      Patients who will participate in this study will need to require a soft tissue graft from the
      mouth to an area that needs additional attached or keratinized mucosa. This will most likely
      be either in preparation for patients who have or will have dental implants placed. Another
      subset of patients are those who need scar tissue released or the vestibule of their mouth
      (area that turns from the gums to the lip) released.
