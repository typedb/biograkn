  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inner city children are at an increased risk for lead overburden. This in turn affects
      cognitive functioning. However, the underlying neuropsychological effects of lead overburden
      and its age-specific effects have not been well delineated. This study is part of a larger
      study on the effects of lead overburden on the development of attention and memory. The
      larger study is using a multi-model approach to study the effects of lead overburden on these
      effects including the event-related potential (ERP), electrophysiologic measures of attention
      and memory are studied. Every eight months, for a total of three sessions the subjects will
      complete ERP measures of attention and memory which require them to watch various computer
      images while wearing scalp electrodes recording from 11 sites. It is this test that we are
      going to be doing on CRC. There will be 30 lead overburdened children recruited from the
      larger study for participation in the ERP studies on CRC. These 30 children will be matched
      with 30 children without lead overburden. This portion of the study is important in providing
      an index of physiological functioning to be used along with behaviorally based measures of
      attention and memory, and for providing information about the different measures.
