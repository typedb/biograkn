  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the ability of extended release nifedipine (Procardia XL), a blood
      pressure medication, to permit a decrease in the dose of glucocorticoid medication children
      take to treat congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to assess both acute and chronic effects of the calcium channel
      antagonist, nifedipine, on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The multicenter trial is composed of two phases and will
      involve a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. The goal of Phase I is to examine
      the ability of nifedipine vs. placebo to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels,
      as well as to begin to assess the dose-dependency of nifedipine effects. The goal of Phase II
      is to evaluate the long-term effects of nifedipine; that is, can attenuation of ACTH release
      by nifedipine permit a decrease in the dosage of glucocorticoid needed to suppress the HPA
      axis? Such a decrease would, in turn, reduce the deleterious effects of glucocorticoid
      treatment in CAH.
